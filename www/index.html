        <div class="section"><h2>Jawr: bundling and compression for web application resources. </h2><p>Jawr is a tunable packaging solution for Javascript and CSS which allows for rapid development of resources in separate module files. Writing a simple descriptor properties file, and using a servlet and a tag library are all the requirements to use it. </p><img src="./images/index/jawr.png" alt="How Jawr will help you" /><p>It is common knowledge that it is faster to serve one large file rather than two smaller ones, because of increased HTTP negotiation and the fact that most browsers only keep two connections open to the same host at any given time. Jawr will reduce the number of requests needed to load a page and the amount of data to transfer to clients, achieving drastic improvement of loading times. With a simple configuration file, resources can be distributed in bundles to best suit the usage pattern for a site. </p><p>A tag library is used to import the resources to pages. In development mode, the tags generate &lt;script&gt; and &lt;style&gt; links for each resource mapped to a bundle. In production mode, the tags generate a single link pointing to the bundle file. Thus, there is no need to change code in pages when switching from development to production mode. </p><p>There is an increasing trend towards richer client interfaces with complex javascript implementations. Using Jawr will ease the development process by allowing to distribute modules in separate files without worrying about how the application will be served to clients. </p><p>The alternatives to using Jawr are: </p><ul><li>Developing all-in-one script files which conform to the deployment scheme. That is, cram all the modules into a few files. Version control becomes unmanageable and it is hard to find a component that needs change. As the project grows, the code becomes near to impossible to mantain. </li><li>Use a build script to join and compress the files, which forces developers to build and redeploy the whole application for testing even the slightest of changes in their code. </li></ul><p>Jawr offers the best of both worlds, by combining a powerful bundling-minifying-compressing scheme for optimal service in production, with a rapid development mode for quick change-save-test cycles. </p><p>You can download the latest release of Jawr <a href="https://jawr.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=8543">here</a>. </p><div class="section"><h3>Features</h3><ul><li><b>Lightweight</b>: Bundling and compression is done once at server startup so there is no overhead to requests. Also, a cache component is available and enabled by default to serve resources directly from memory instead of from the filesystem. </li><li><b>Easy to setup</b>: All you need to start using Jawr is to declare a couple of servlets in you deployment descriptor, create a simple .properties configuration file, and use the Jawr tag library to import css and javascript resources to your pages. </li><li><b>Built-in minification and postprocessing</b>: Jawr includes JSMin, the minification library by Douglas Crockford of Yahoo!. A custom minificator for CSS is also included. For each bundle, a customizable postprocessing chain is executed during startup. Relative URLs in CSS are rewritten by a postprocessor so they keep working with a different relative path. Future Jawr versions will include other postprocessors such as different minificators. </li><li><b>Proxy-friendly gzip support</b>: For each bundle there are two URLs that point to a gzipped and a regular version of the resource. Since the URLs are be generated within a JSP, the request headers are analyzed to decide if the browser will support gzipping and the appropiate URL is written out. With this system, caching proxies will not be a problem since it works around known Internet Explorer problems with the VARY header. </li><li><b>Caching enforcement</b>: Jawr will try its best to force your clients to cache the resources. If a browser asks if a file changed, a 304 (not modified) header is sent back with no content. On the other hand, with Jawr you will be 100% sure that new versions of your bundles are downloaded by all clients. Every URL to your resources will include a prefix that you can change in the configuration file. Once you deploy a new version, the URL to the bundle will change as well so it will be impossible that a client uses an older, cached version. </li><li><b>Flexible bundling scheme</b>: Choose which files go into which bundle, and in which order. Choose wether you want a bundle minified or not. Choose wether a bundle will be used only in development mode (for adding things such as console loggers). Create partially minified bundles. All with a very easy to use configuration system. </li><li><b>Global bundles</b>: Some bundles such as libraries will be needed anywhere in your site where there is javascript code. Same goes for base CSS stylesheets. With Jawr, these will be added to pages automatically so you don't need to repeat the same import statement everywhere. </li><li><b>Library friendly</b>: Open source libraries can be used seamlessly with Jawr. Most of these are modular or have plugins: add the modules or plugins you need and bundle all together. And, even if you minify them (thus eliminating comments), you can still keep the mandatory licenses in the bundle. </li></ul></div><div class="section"><h3>Requirements</h3><p>You can use Jawr with any compliant Java Web Container implementation (i.e. Tomcat, Jetty, BEA Weblogic etc.), as long as the virtual machine version is 1.4 or higher. Jawr uses Apache log4j for logging messages, so it is a required library. There are no other requirements, although if your virtual machine version is 1.4, you can improve performance by using the backport-util-concurrent library, which can be found at: <a href="http://backport-jsr166.sourceforge.net/">http://backport-jsr166.sourceforge.net/</a>. However, this is completely optional and Jawr will work just fine if you choose not to use it. </p></div><div class="section"><h3>Announcements</h3><ul><li><b>1/31/2008</b>: Version 1.1 released, fixes a major problem with the taglib descriptor and adds the option to use @startup for generating bundle prefixes upon deployment. </li></ul></div></div>
