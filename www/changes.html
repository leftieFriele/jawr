<ul><li><strong>2/13/2009</strong>: Version 2.7 released:<br />
<strong>New features/ fixed issues: </strong><ul><li>
      		 EL expressions in tag libraries are now supported on older servlet containers, thanks to a patch 
      		 submitted by Ibrahim Chaehoi. 
      		 </li>
<li>
      		 The jawr.*.bundle.names property is now deprecated, also thanks to a patch submitted by Ibrahim Chaehoi. 
      		 <strong>You may remove all jawr.js.bundle.names and jawr.css.bundle.names from your descriptors</strong>. 
      		 You can still use them if you feel more comfortable that way. 
      		 </li>
<li>
      		 Jawr now supports jawr.url.contextpath.override that begin with: //.  This is a protocol relative url 
      		 structure. It's handy when you are sharing your css and/or js with different domains and protocols.  
      		 So these // urls will work relative to http and https. 
      		 </li>
<li>
      		 Added jawr.css.imagepath.override property to allow for css url replacement that supports absolute URLs or 
      		 really anything you would like prepended to the URL.  This is usefull if you are sharing your css 
      		 across multiple domains and use background images.
      		 </li>
<li>
      		 Classloading has been improved to better support the 18n messages generator, which failed to load 
      		 properties files under certain conditions. 
      		 </li>
<li>
      		 Fixed issue 49 (with no jawr.csslinks.flavor setting, style tags are ended with 'null')
      		 </li>
<li>
      		 Fixed issue 56 (incorrect path management in Spring MVC controller )
      		 </li>
</ul>

      This release includes code from our new commiter, <strong>Matt Ruby</strong>. Welcome aboard!. Also, as noted 
      above, <strong>Ibrahim Chaehoi</strong> submitted a couple of high quality patches that were included in the 
      release. Thanks a lot Ibrahim! 
      </li>
<li><strong>11/23/2008</strong>: Version 2.6 released:<br />
<strong>New features/ fixed issues: </strong><ul><li><strong>Spring MVC support added. </strong> Jawr now provides a Spring MVC Controller so it can now be fully configured 
      		 through Spring's configuration mechanism. See <a href="./integration/spring.html">the manual page</a>
 for details. </li>
<li>The way LINK tags are rendered can now be configured. Specifically, depending on the content type you choose for your 
      		 pages, you may need the link tags to be closed differently, or even not closed at all. By default, tags will be closed as 
      		 usual (i.e. with '/&gt;'). But adding a new parameter to the properties configuration will make this behavior change. 
      		 Check the <a href="./docs/taglibs.html"> taglib documentation</a>
 and look for 'jawr.csslinks.flavor' for details.  </li>
<li>A new generator has been added. Now CSS resources can be retrieved from the classpath by using the 
      		 <strong>jar_css</strong> prefix. </li>
<li>[Issue #46] The jawr[css|js].bundle.names property is now augmentable when using ConfigPropertiesAugmenter, 
      		 as it should have from the start. </li>
<li>[Unregistered Issue] Jawr does not close the outputstream nor the output writers handed by the servlet container, since 
      		 that's an illegal operation, as was pointed out by user Lance. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>11/9/2008</strong>: Version 2.5.1 released:<br />
<strong>New features/ fixed issues: </strong><ul><li>[Grails, issue #26] Switched from using controllers to using a servlet: This has several advantages: it is faster, there is no 
      		 need to fiddle with the grails.mime.file.extensions property, and no controller mappings need to be added. So if you are upgrading, you 
      		 need to remove the controller mappings, reset the grails.mime.file.extensions property and then follow URL mapping instructions at the 
      		 <a href="./integration/grails.html">plugin instructions page</a>
. </li>
<li>[Grails, issue #32] New grails-only implementation of the i18n messages generator that solves all previous issues. It is no longer 
      		 needed to copy properties files when deploying/running in war mode, and the previous message character encoding issues should 
      		 be gone for good. </li>
<li>[Issue #44] Added code to respond with 304 to requests having the If-None-Match header. </li>
<li>Link tags are now ended with '/&gt;' as opposed to &lt;/link&gt;to improve validability. While in a perfect word 
      		there should be no closing tag at all in non-xhtml documents, this seems to be the best compromise.</li>
<li>Fixed improper exception handling at some points where stack data was being spoiled. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>10/7/2008</strong>: Version 2.5 released:<br />
<strong>New features: </strong><ul><li>CDN support: Jawr can be used with a CDN by setting the parameter to an absolute URL. </li>
<li><a href="./docs/generators.html">Generators API</a>
: you can now write components that dynamically generate scripts or 
      		 CSS during the application startup. </li>
<li>Ability to read config the file from the filesystem: instead of reading only from the classpath, the config properties file 
      		 can now be read from the filesystem. To do it the config parameter must be prefixed with file:, followed by the absolute file path. </li>
<li><a href="./integration/augmenter.html">Multiple configuration sources</a>
 can be used when integrating Jawr with other frameworks.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Fixed issues:</strong><ul><li>#31:media=&quot;print&quot; ignored when useRandomParam=&quot;false&quot; </li>
<li>#29:Contextpath override does not work with absolute URLs (see CDN support above)</li>
<li>#19:PropsFilePropertiesSource.configChanged() doesn't work on Tomcat (now properties can be read from the filesystem)</li>
<li>Also, a new version of the DWR 3 has been published, fixing the latest incompatibilities. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>7/7/2008</strong>: Version 2.4.2 released:<br />
 
      	A performance improvement has been added: buffering is now used when using writers. Thanks to Richie for submitting a patch. <br />

      	There was a bug causing CSS URLs to be broken when using the static pages resource includer, which is now fixed. 
      	</li>
<li><strong>6/16/2008</strong>: Version 2.4.1 released:<br />
 
      	A bug was introduced in the last release which kept DWR 2 from working with Jawr. This release fixes that bug. <br />

      	Also, a new interface has been added which ConfigPropertiesSource custom implementations can use to get access to the servlet 
      	context. The class is named net.jawr.web.resource.bundle.factory.util.ServletContextAware. 
      	
      	</li>
<li><strong>6/16/2008</strong>: Version 2.4 released:<br />
<strong>Jawr can be used in plain HTML pages</strong>: This has been a major drawback for Jawr, since many times applications are a mix of 
      	static HTML and dynamic pages. <a href="./docs/plain_html.html"> Click here to find out how this has been solved. </a>
</li>
<li><strong>6/9/2008</strong>: Version 2.3 released:<br />
<strong>Commons Validator integration</strong>: Users of Struts and other libraries 
      	supporting the Commons Validator can now have the static and dynamic scripts added to bundles, minified and compressed with Jawr.  
      	<br />
<strong>DWR 3 support: </strong> Jawr now supports the upcoming version 3 of the DWR framework. 
      	<br />
	
      		Locale bundles can now be used as part of composite bundles. 
      	<br />
				      	
				Several bugs were fixed: 
				<ul><li> Grails i18n messages encoding fix. </li>
<li> i18n messages replacement was not working properly. </li>
<li> i18n bug in mappings (parameters were parsed incorrectly). </li>
<li> Bug with 'dwr:_**' mapping in debug mode. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>6/2/2008</strong>: Version 2.2 released:<br />
<strong>DWR integration</strong>: DWR users can now leverage the new integration with Jawr, 
      	which allows bundling all DWR resources along with other static scripts. <br />
<strong>Mapping of classpath resources: </strong> bundles can now map to  resources (javascript and CSS) which are available in the classpath. 
      	<br />
				      	
				Also, several bugs were fixed: 
				<ul><li> bug in i18n message generation: was failing when a dollar sign was found in a message. </li>
<li> bug for i18n messages: in debug mode, would get 404s if the mapping was not set to attend *.js requests. </li>
<li> bug in CSS link rewriter, which failed when Jawr mapping had several subdomains. </li>
<li> Decreased logging verbosity of the ConcurrentCollectionsFactory. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>5/19/2008</strong>: Version 2.1 released: <strong>i18n messages mapping from java ResourceBundles to javascript:</strong> 
      	your internationalized messages that you keep in properties files can be easily converted into a script that allows for easy access to 
      	every message and supports variable substitution. According tho the user's locale, the script generated will correspond to his language.   
      	<br />
Other than that, mostly internal changes and bugfixes. The internal changes include a new system to 
      	map to Generators. These are java components which generate javascript/CSS, or read it from a different place than the usual WAR directories.
      	This opens interesting possibilities for the near future. 
      	</li>
<li><strong>4/5/2008</strong>: Version 2.0 released: new automatic prefixing system, conditional comments support, grails and facelets 
      	plugins, YUI compressor... Check the <a href="./docs/changes_20.html">what's new in 2.0 page</a>
 for a description of all the new features and fixes.
