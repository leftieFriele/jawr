Jawr plugin for Grails

	For a Grails user, it is easy to instal Jawr and start using it. The steps to follow are to install the plugin, configure it with the same 
	properties format used in the standard version, and add a couple of URL mapping statements.     
	
=====================
	<<Warning:>>	If you are upgrading from a version prior to 2.51, be aware that Jawr now uses a servlet instead of a controller to serve its files. 
	This has several advantages: it is faster, there is no need to fiddle with the grails.mime.file.extensions property, and no controller mappings 
	need to be added. So if you are upgrading, you need to remove the controller mappings, reset the grails.mime.file.extensions property and then 
	follow URL mapping instructions below.   

=====================

* Installing the plugin

	Just execute following from your application directory:
	
	grails install-plugin Jawr
	
	If above method does not work for some reason you can download the plugin distribution from 
	{{{https://jawr.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=8991}this page}} and install it with:
	
	grails install-plugin /path/to/downloaded/plugin.zip
	

* Configuration

	To configure Jawr you must add properties to the Config.groovy file located at the /conf folder of your application. The syntax you must use 
	is exactly the same described for the .properties file used in standard java web applications. Check the 
	{{{./descriptor_syntax.html}config file syntax page}} for details. Of course, the property values must be quoted in order to avoid syntax errors. 
	Keep in mind that there are a few property keys that don't apply when using 
	Jawr with Grails. Those are: 
	
	* <<jawr.config.reload.interval>>: The Jawr servlet can be configured to listen to changes to the .properies file to reload it when it changes. 
	In Grails, Jawr will instead listen to changes to the Config.groovy script to reload its configuration. This happens automatically when you 
	start grails in development mode (but keep in mind that the changes are applied after you refresh a page in your browser). 
	
	* <<jawr.charset.name>>: The value set for grails.views.gsp.encoding will be used for this attribute (which is 'utf-8' by default in Grails). 
	
	* <<jawr.locale.resolver>>: Jawr will use Grails' Locale resolution strategy when it applies.  
	
	[]
	
	
	Using this syntax, you will be able to define bundles as specified in the relevant documentation pages. Note that you are not forced to use 
	Jawr for both js and css files. If you add none of the jawr.css.* parameters, for instance, Jawr will do no effort to serve CSS files. 
	
	Jawr uses log4j to log messages, so you can configure its tracing level along with the rest of your application. All jawr packages start 
	with net.jawr.*, so you can use that as a key for an appender.   

	The configuration will indicate to the plugin which Jawr servlet to start.
	
	So if you configure only JS bundle, the plugin will start only the Jawr JS servlet.
	So to enable the JS or the CSS servlet, you must at least define a bundle of the specified type.
	To enable the Jawr Image servlet, you need to define one of the following property :
		* jawr.img.mapping
		* jawr.css.image.classpath.use.servlet
		* jawr.img.* (Any property which starts with jawr.img)
		* jawr.image.* (Any property which starts with jawr.image)
		
** URL mapping

	There are two ways to map Jawr to requests:  
	
	* You can have Jawr respond to all requests ending in .js and .css, thus letting Jawr control all requests to your resources. This is the 
	default behavior, and you don't need to configure anything at all for it to work, simply omit the jawr.js.mapping/jawr.css.mapping properties 
	from your config and you are ready to go. 
	
		* This is the usual 
		approach, but you may want to bundle only part of your code and serve the rest normally. This is specially useful if you are adding Jawr to an 
		existing application and you do not want to change every existing script tag. Note that Jawr handles individual files (you don't need to 
		explicitly define a bundle for every file you want to compress and serve standalone), so that should not keep you from using this mapping 
		method.
			
	* You can define a URL fragment as a prefix (such as '/jawr/') to prefix every URL. Jawr will only serve requests containing this prefix. To 
	use this you must add two special parameters to your Config.groovy file, to specify the prefixes for js and css: 

+------------------------------------------+	
jawr.js.mapping = '/script/' // The value can be anything you want for the prefix
jawr.css.mapping = '/style/'
+------------------------------------------+
	
	Note that the value for these properties <<must>> be a url-mapping string without the wildcard (i.e. with no asterisk). 
	
	With either method, once you have filled out the properties, you will be ready to start adding Jawr tags to your pages. 
	 
	* Image URL mapping
	
	By default, Jawr will handle the following image types : .png, .jpeg, .jpg, .gif, .ico.
	
	You can configure the image mapping by settings the <<jawr.img.mappings>>.
	If you want to define a set of extension file to handle, you need to list the extension with a smi colon separator, like this :
	
+-----------------------------------------+
jawr.img.mapping='*.png; *.jpg; *.gif'
+-----------------------------------------+	
	
* Using the tag library

	The tag library for grails works exactly the same as the JSP version, so you will find all the details in the 
	{{{./taglibs.html}JSP taglib documentation page}}. 
	
	The only difference is that in GSP pages there is no need to import the tags at all. Also, keep in mind that the namespace for the 
	Jawr taglib is 'jawr:'. 
	
	This is how you would use the tags in a typical page:  
	  
+------------------------------------------+	
<html>
 <head>
	<jawr:script src="/bundles/yui.js"  />
	<jawr:style src="/bundles/all.css" />
 </head>
 <body>
	...
	<jawr:img src="/images/logo.png" />
 </body>
</html>

+------------------------------------------+
