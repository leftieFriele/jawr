Using DWR with Jawr

	{{{http://getahead.org/dwr/}DWR}} (Direct Web Remoting) is a java library which allows Javascript in a browser to interact with Java on a 
	server and helps you manipulate	web pages with the results.  
	
	DWR works by setting up one or several servlets which serve javascript and also convert AJAX requests  to java class method invocations. The 
	javascript served by DWR is either one of several static .js files or a generated javascript stub that allows method calls to be routed to 
	the server via AJAX. 
	
	DWR already has a method to minify and compress javascript, but Jawr adds extra functionality so that you serve your resources more 
	consistently. Specifically, with JAWR you can serve all the static .js files in one bundle. You can also combine these with other scripts. 
	For instance, you could have a javascript bundle containng Prototype.js, script.aculo.us, your own infrastructure and the DWR static scripts. 
	
	Also, you can bundle together the generated javascript stubs which normally must be requested separately. For pages that use several remote 
	objects, this can speed up loading. 
	
	Finally, using this approach you have a consistent way of serving all javascript, instead of using different methods to serve DWR scripts or 
	Jawr bundles. 
	
	There is a sample application that you can download to chek out how integration with DWR works, which you can download from 
	{{{https://jawr.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=9330}this page}}. 
	
* Set up

	The jawr servlet must be started after the DWR one. To make sure this order is followed, you must set up the <load-on-startup> parameter 
	so that the value for the Jawr servlet is greater than the one for the DWR servlet: 
		
+------------------------------------------+	
	<servlet>
	   <servlet-name>dwr-invoker</servlet-name>
	   <display-name>DWR Servlet</display-name>
	   <description>Direct Web Remoter Servlet</description>
	   <servlet-class>org.directwebremoting.servlet.DwrServlet</servlet-class>
	   ...
	   <load-on-startup>1</load-on-startup> <-- Loads first 
	</servlet>
  
	<servlet>
		<servlet-name>JavascriptServlet</servlet-name>
		<servlet-class>net.jawr.web.servlet.JawrServlet</servlet-class>
	   ...
	   <load-on-startup>2</load-on-startup> <-- Loads after DWR
	</servlet>
+------------------------------------------+	

	Jawr needs to know the sevlet mapping that points to DWR. Therefore, in the properties config you must set up the <<jawr.dwr.mapping>> 
	parameter to the same value (without the wildcard) that you use for the DWR servlet: 
	
+------------------------------------------+	
  Web.xml: 
  <servlet-mapping>
    <servlet-name>dwr-invoker</servlet-name>
    <url-pattern>/dwr/*</url-pattern>
  </servlet-mapping>
  
  Jawr.properties:
  jawr.dwr.mapping=/dwr/
+------------------------------------------+	
	
** Additional DWR servlet instances

	If you declare more than one DWR servlet, Jawr will need to access the additional mappings for these. In this case, for every additional 
	servlet you must add a special init-param, named <<jawr_mapping>>. The value, again, must be the servlet-mapping used for the servlet, without 
	the wildcard. Note that this init-param is added to the DWR servlet config,	<<not>> the Jawr servlet config. 
	
+------------------------------------------+	
   <servlet>
    <servlet-name>additional-dwr-invoker</servlet-name>
    <display-name>DWR Servlet</display-name>
    <description>Direct Web Remoter Servlet</description>
    <servlet-class>org.directwebremoting.servlet.DwrServlet</servlet-class>
    ...
    <init-param>
	    <param-name>jawr_mapping</param-name>
	    <param-value>/other/dwr/</param-value> <-- Matches servlet-mapping
    </init-param>
    ...
   </servlet>
  <servlet-mapping>
    <servlet-name>additional-dwr-invoker</servlet-name>
    <url-pattern>/other/dwr/*</url-pattern> <-- Use in jawr_mapping
  </servlet-mapping>
   
+------------------------------------------+	
	
	You need to do this for additional DWR servlets, but you can skip it for the one to which mapping you point in the <<jawr.dwr.mapping>> param.
	You can't skip using this param though, since it acts as a flag to Jawr indicating that DWR integration is on. 
	
* Maping DWR resources in bundles

	Once you have performed setup, you can start using DWR beans in your bundle mappings. All DWR resources are mapped using the special prefix 
	'<<dwr:>>'. As stated before, DWR has several static resources that you will probably want to bundle with the rest of your javascript 
	infrastructure code (Prototype, YUI or whichever, etc). You map to these using several special keywords: 
	
*---------------+---------+
| <<Keyword>> | <<DWR script>>    | 
*---------------+---------+
| dwr:_engine | engine.js  | 
*---------------+---------+
| dwr:_util | util.js  | 
*---------------+---------+
| dwr:_auth | auth.js  | 
*---------------+---------+
| dwr:_actionutil | DWRActionUtil.js (webwork integration)  | 
*---------------+---------+

	The engine.js script should always be included first since others depend on it. Note that this file is not completaly static, since 
	DWR generates some variables depending on the user's request. This is not optimal, since users will get a new copy on every new session with 
	the application. Jawr solves this by generating these parameters in a very small inline script that contains only the dynamic variables. 
	
	So in a typical use case, you would be adding these to a global bundle: 
	
	
+------------------------------------------+  
	jawr.js.bundle.names=global
	
	jawr.js.bundle.global.id=/bundles/global.js
	jawr.js.bundle.global.mappings=/js/protaculous/**, dwr:_engine, dwr:_util
	jawr.js.bundle.global.global=true
+------------------------------------------+	
	 
	 
	To add DWR beans (the javascript stubs to access java objects in the server), you use the <<dwr:>> prefix followed by the name you specified 
	in the dwr.xml config file (or in the alternate configuration method of your choice). 
	
	For instance, the following mapping adds two of these beans to a bundle:

+------------------------------------------+  
    dwr.xml: 
    <create creator="new" javascript="People" scope="script"> <-- Use the value of the 'javascript' attribute
      <param name="class" value="org.getahead.dwrdemo.people.People"/>
    </create>
	<create creator="new" javascript="LiveHelp" scope="application">
      <param name="class" value="org.getahead.dwrdemo.livehelp.LiveHelp"/>
    </create>
    
    jawr.config:
    jawr.js.bundle.mybundle.mappings=dwr:People, dwr:LiveHelp
	
+------------------------------------------+		

	Note that Jawr does not support having several DWR servlets that map to beans with the same names. You can't declare two DWR servlets with a 
	bean named 'Person', for instance. 
	
	One last thing you can do is to bundle <<all>> dwr beans into one bundle. To do this, tou use the special keyword <<dwr:_**>>: 

+------------------------------------------+  
   This adds all beans defined in dwr.xml: 
   jawr.js.bundle.alldwrbeans.mappings=_**
	
+------------------------------------------+	
	
	Be aware that this mapping does not include the static DWR scripts, only the bean stubs. Here is an example of an all-in-one DWR bundle: 
	
	
+------------------------------------------+  
	jawr.js.bundle.names=dwrall
	
	jawr.js.bundle.dwrall.id=/bundles/dwrall.js
	jawr.js.bundle.dwrall.mappings=dwr:_engine, dwr:_util,dwr:_auth, dwr:_**	
+------------------------------------------+
