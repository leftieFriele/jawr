Changes and new features in version 2.0

* New features

	* <<Bundle prefixes are now automatic>>: It will no longer necessary to keep a track on bundle prefixes when deploying new versions. 
	Jawr will generate prefixes based on the hash of generated bundles. The prefix will change only when changes are made to members of 
	a bundle, so unchanged bundles will keep the previous bundle (thanks to frankern for the idea).  
	
	* <<Minification and obfuscation using the YUI compressor>>: Now the YUI Compressor is available as a postprocessor to minify both js and CSS files. 
	It can also obfuscate javascript. 
	
	* <<Grails support>>: a plugin has been created to use with Grails (AKA Groovy on rails). 
	
	* <<Facelets support>>: Jawr can now be used wiithin Facelets applications, using a newly created, specific tag library. 
	
	* <<Internet Explorer only bundles>>: now a bundle can be declared with a conditional comment expression, using the property 
	jawr.[type].bundle.[name].ieonly.condition (for instance, 'jawr.js.bundle.mybundle.ieonly.condition=if lte IE 6'). 
	When imported to a page, Jawr will generate a conditional comment around the bundle, using the provided expression. 	
	
	* It is now possible to use -Dnet.jawr.debug.on as a jvm startup option to override debug mode configuration. Useful to add to production 
	server startup script, avoiding to set debug mode in production by mistake.  	
	
	* Better error reporting for JSmin errors. A trace shows the line where the error happened, plus some of 
	The previous content. 


* Bug fixes
	
	* From the first release there has been an issue with css images when using a mapping to the servlet ('/somepath/*' instead of '/*.css'). 
	The paths were broken in debug mode and now this has been fixed.  
	
	* Issue #7: Fixed random parameter skipping when debug and gzip options are activated. 
	
	* Issue #14: Domain relative URLs in CSS files are left unchanged by the postprocessor. 
	
	* Issue #16: CSS rules with whitespace other than spaces were being joined by the minifier. 
	
	* Issue #17: Using HTML comments was problematic when using conditional IE comments. Now Jawr generates a 
	script tag with an embedded comment instead of an HTML comment. 
	
	* Issue #19: Classloader problem in Tomcat made config reloading impossible.  
	
	* NPE in Tomcat during Jawr servlet init process. 
	
	* Fixed a bug in config system, by which jawr.[].use.cache had no effect in config. 
	
	* Fixed a bug in CachedResourceBundlesHandler, non-gzipped files were being served empty upon a first request. It's a fix for a 
	problem known as 'works for debug only' in the forums.
